# Quine
A quine is a computer program which takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing))

This is a short implementation of a Quine with python based on the general strategy defined in Michael Sipser's book "Introduction to the Theory of Computation"
